    <p>
    <b>CRIC Searchable Image Database</b> is a public cervical cell image database aiming supporting cervical cancer analysis of Pap smear. We have collected hundreds of hand labeled segmentation and classification of cervical cells from 4 (four) human specialists (pathologists). The database is a collaborative work among Federal University of Ouro Preto, Federal University of Ceará and University of California-Berkeley.  
	</p>

  <p>We hope CRIC Searchable Image Database will become a useful resource for cervical cancer investigation and may help physicians to provide a healthier life for women worldwide.</p>
